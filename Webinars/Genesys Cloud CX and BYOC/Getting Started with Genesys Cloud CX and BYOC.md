# 1. Genesys Cloud CX Interface Walkthrough

- The Genesys cloud access URL would differ depending on the base region chosen while signing up.
- [Login URL for each region](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/aws-regions-for-genesys-cloud-deployment/)
- Genesys Web portal is a role-driven application, we could see options in the portal based on the Roles.

# 2. Understanding User Permissions
- Genesys Cloud is a Role Driven Application
- The role is a combination of multiple Permissions
- A permission decides what exactly a user can do in Genesys Cloud (Basic User, Agent, Supervisor, Master Administrator, Telephony Admin, Integration Admin, etc.)
- The role assigned to a user decides which license to use (Collaborate, Communicate, CX1, CX2, CX3)

# 3. User Management in Genesys Cloud CX
- Users can be created manually, bulk-imported with CSV, APIs, or SCIM (Cloud IdP Push)
## 3.1. Creating New User in Genesys Cloud CX

# 3. Genesys Cloud CX Edge Server
- Edge is available as Cloud-based and Premises
- The Edge is a cloud-managed device that combines a Media server, SIP registrar, SIP proxy, and call recorder into a single piece of hardware on-premises.
- Phone Trunk and External Trunks talks to Edge Server
- In Genesys Cloud CX Voice and BYOC Cloud, the Edge is in AWS, and Genesys fully manage it
- Edge servers are grouped to Edge Group and made available to Sites
- In a fully cloud solution, the cloud edge group is associated with the core site - PureCloud Voice â€“ AWS, and the rest of the sites share the same

# 4. Understanding Location and Sites
## 4.1 Location
- A Genesys Cloud CX location is a geographic area of an organization where users are located.
- For organizations with multiple physical sites, locations are used to configure emergency services (such as E911 in the US), ensuring that emergency calls are routed to the appropriate local authorities.
- Locations can be used in reporting and analytics to understand the performance and operations of different geographical areas.
- Location will be displayed under the user profile can easily identify where the user belongs to
- To create a Site, we should have a Location first

## 4.2 Site
- It is the home of a set of phones and edge devices and defines the Telephony properties (Dial-Plan, Outbound Routes)
- It has RegEx based dial-plan, Trunk Association, etc.
- Every site must be associated with one location. An organization can have multiple locations assigned to it in Genesys Cloud CX.
- In a Fully Cloud Edge Solution, any site that you create obtains Edge details from the core site (PureCloud Voice - AWS)
