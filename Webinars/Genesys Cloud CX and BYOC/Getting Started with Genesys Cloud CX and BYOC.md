# 2. Understanding User Permissions
- Genesys Cloud is a Role Driven Application
- The role is a combination of multiple Permissions
- A permission decides what exactly a user can do in Genesys Cloud (Basic User, Agent, Supervisor, Master Administrator, Telephony Admin, Integration Admin, etc.)
- The role assigned to a user decides which license to use (Collaborate, Communicate, CX1, CX2, CX3)
