# CUCM - MS Teams Integration Webinar (03/Nov/2023 09:00PM IST)
Unlocking Seamless Communication in the Modern Workplace
In today's fast-paced business world, effective communication and collaboration are the cornerstones of success. As organizations seek to empower their teams and connect with customers across the globe, the intersection of technologies becomes pivotal. That's where this webinar comes in â€“ a deep dive into the integration of two giants in the communication and collaboration space, **Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM)** and **Microsoft Teams**, facilitated by **Cisco CUBE** with **Direct Routing feature**...!

</p>

Join us for a comprehensive exploration of how to bridge the gap between these two industry leaders, enhancing your ability to connect, communicate, and collaborate with unparalleled efficiency. Our webinar will cover everything you need to know about bringing the power of Microsoft Teams into the Cisco Unified Communications environment, leveraging the robust capabilities of Cisco CUBE as the bridge.

The session will be conducted via Zoom Meeting Platform, I Strongly recommend to **install Zoom App** for the smooth experience.

## Call Routing Architecture

## Dial Plan Design
![image](https://github.com/vpjaseem/collaboration/assets/67306692/973840bf-3cab-4659-957e-2ee3208a22d6)

**CUCM to MS Teams** 
- Same DID +12176411001 assigned to IP Phone and MS Teams
- MS Teams require proper E.164 Pattern to route the incoming call
- CUCM Uses 8XXXX to dial Teams Extension, this will be translated to 881217641XXXX from Route Pattern level itself
- At the CUBE level, remove the 88 and add + then the number becomes +1217641XXXX (e.g. +1217641-1001)
- Teams will handle the proper E.164 Number and extend the call to Teams App

**MS Teams to CUCM**
- User is assigned with a dial-pan ^11(\d{3})$ to select proper 5 digit extension
- User assigned with a Voice Routing Policy that is having a PSTN Usage Record
- ^11(\d{3})$ Voice route having PSTN Usage Record will send the call to CUBE
- CUBE route same call to to CUCM
- Extension rings

## Configuration Steps
1. Overview of Lab Topology and final goal
2. Review of CUCM Current Setup (Registered IP Phones with CTL, Tomcat MSAN Certificates, [CallManager MSAN Certificate](https://youtu.be/d6gZiEG2bMw), Device Pools, Regions, Partitions, CSS)
3. *[CUCM]* Configure SIP Profile, SIP Trunk Security Profile, SIP Trunk
4. *[CUCM]* Configure Route Group, Route List and Route Pattern (8XXXX > 881217641XXXX)
5. *[CUBE]* voice class uri, voice class server-group 1, voice class codec, ip address trusted list, Translation Profile, Dial-Peers, e164 pattern maps
6. *[CUBE]* Installing Public SSL Certificate in CUBE (crypto key commands, crypto pki trustpoint)
7. *[Firewall]* Public IP Address and NAT Configurations / Port Forwarding
8. *[CUCM]* Migrating CUCM - CUBE SIP trunk to Secure SIP Trunk (TLS 5061 Port, Root Certificate Upload)
9. *[MS Teams]* License Assigment, Adding SBC, Voice Route, PSTN Usage Record, Voice Routing Policy, Dial-Plan with Normalization
10. *[CUBE]* SIP Profiles, Options Ping, voice service voip, voice class tenant 200, sip-ua
11. Test calls between CUCM and MS Teams
12. Simultaneous Ring Feature (CUCM "SNR" and SM Teams "Ring also Ring" feature)

## Firewall / NAT Configurations
The CUBE must have a Public IP for interconnecting Microsoft Teams and CUBE. There are multiple ways to get Public IP to CUBE, either directly assign Public IP in one of the CUBE interfaces or configure NAT, so that it can translate Private IP of CUBE to Public IP. For Enterprise deployments, have meeting with your network and firewall team to get this completed. In my case, I do have a Public IP and will be doing the NAT. This will make sure any SIP, HTTP, RTP Traffic to my public IP will be forwarded to Private IP of CUBE which is 192.168.0.11
