## Dial Plan Design

**CUCM to MS Teams** 
- Same DID +12176411001 assigned to IP Phone and MS Teams
- MS Teams require proper E.164 Pattern to route the incoming call
- CUCM Uses 81001 to dial Teams Extension, this will be translated to 88-1217641-1001
- At the CUBE level, remove the 88 and add + then the number becomes +1217641-1001
- Teams will handle the proper E.164 Number and extend the call to Teams App

**MS Teams to CUCM**
- +11001 Voice route will send the call to CUBE
- CUBE removed the + and route to CUCM
- Extension rings
